** You may set these define to either 0 or 1 to change the behaviour of some fu
** nctions.
** `SPYVERBOSE` prints warning when invalid pointers are detected.
** `SPYBRAVE` causes invalid pointers to be processed like valid ones.
** `SPYPROXY` causes mallocspy to treat pointers as being "second degree" inste
** ad of first degree. In other words, you register the adress of a variable th
** at holds a pointer instead of the pointer itself.
** This operating mode is a little more complex to uses, but has a handful of a
** dvantages :
**  - Pointer in registered variables can be changed without interfacing with M
** allocspy; pointers that are freed then reallocated in-place won't need to be
**  manually unregistered and re-registered.
**  - Pointers that are freed then set to NULL without interfacing with Mallocs
** py can be automatically detected and unregistered in bulk using `SpyClean`.
** You must however make sure to unregister such variable before they are thems
** selves deallocated (heap) or fall out of scope (stack).
**  - Mallocspy will in most case, never end up obfuscating leaks from tools li
** ke Valgrind. (Unless the registered variable also happens to be an allocated
**  pointer itself.)
